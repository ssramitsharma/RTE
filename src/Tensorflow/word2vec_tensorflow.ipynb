    "# Polysemy: the problem with word2vec\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* When humans write dictionaries and thesauruses, we define concepts in relation to other concepts. \n",
    "* For automatic natural language processing, it's often more effective to use dictionaries that define concepts in terms of their usage statistics. \n",
    "* The word2vec family of models are the most popular way of creating these dictionaries. \n",
    "* Given a large sample of text, word2vec gives you a dictionary where each definition is just a row of, say, 300 floating-point numbers. \n",
    "* To find out whether two entries in the dictionary are similar, you ask how similar their definitions are — a well-defined mathematical operation.\n",
    "* he problem with word2vec is the word part. \n",
    "* Consider a word like duck. No individual usage of the word duck refers to the concept \"a waterfowl, or the action of crouching\". \n",
    "* But that's the concept that word2vec is trying to model — because it smooshes all senses of the words together. \n",
    "* Nalisnick and Ravi (2015) noticed this problem, and suggested that we should allow word vectors to grow arbitrarily, so that we can do a better job of modelling complicated concepts. \n",
    "* This seems like a nice approach for subtle sense distinctions, but for cases like duck it's not so satisfying. What we want to do is have different vectors for the different senses. \n",
    "* They also want a simple way of knowing which meaning a given usage refers to. \n",
    "* For this, they need to analyse tokens in context. \n",
    "* This is where spaCy comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Sense2vec: Using NLP annotations for more precise vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "* The idea behind sense2vec is super simple. \n",
    "* If the problem is that duck as in waterfowl and duck as in crouch are different concepts, the straight-forward solution is to just have two entries, duckN and duckV. \n",
    "* They've wanted to try this for some time. \n",
    "* So when Trask et al (2015) published a nice set of experiments showing that the idea worked well, they were easy to convince.\n",
    "* They follow Trask et al in adding part-of-speech tags and named entity labels to the tokens. \n",
    "* Additionally, they merge named entities and base noun phrases into single tokens, so that they receive a single vector. \n",
    "* They're very pleased with the results from this, even though we consider the current version an early draft. * There's a lot more that can be done with the idea. \n",
    "* Multi-word verbs such as get up and give back and even take a walk or make a decision would be great extensions. \n",
    "* They also don't do anything currently to trim back phrases that are compositional — phrases which really are two words."
