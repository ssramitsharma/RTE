# Recognizing textual entailment : A comprehensive evaluation of the existing state of the art techniques
# Abstract
Textual entailment is defined as a directional relationship between pairs of
text expressions, denoted by T - the entailing Text, and H - the entailed
Hypothesis.T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning
of T, as would typically be interpreted by people.The Hypothesis H of an
entailment pair contradicts the Text T if a human reader would say that
the relations/events described by H are highly unlikely to be true given
the relations/events described by T. The three-way RTE task requires that
systems label each entailment pair as either Entailed,Contradicted, or Un-
known.Many natural language processing applications, like Question Answer-
ing (QA), Information Extraction (IE), (multi-document) summarization and
machine translation (MT) evaluation, need to recognize that a particular tar-
get meaning can be inferred from different text variants. Typically entailment
is used as part of a larger system, for example in a prediction system to filter
out trivial or obvious predictions.The main focus of the work would be to
do a survey on the existing state of the art techniques used for recognizing
textual entailment and to do a comparative evaluation between any of the
two techniques .The work will also look into the application of RTE for short
answer grading.

# Introduction

* Textual entailment is defined as a directional relationship between pairs
of text expressions, denoted by T - the entailing Text, and H - the
entailed Hypothesis.
* T entails H if the meaning of H can be inferred from the meaning of T,
as would typically be interpreted by people.
* The Hypothesis H of an entailment pair contradicts the Text T if a
human reader would say that the relations/events described by H are
highly unlikely to be true given the relations/events described by T.
* The three-way RTE task requires that systems label each entailment
pair as either Entailed,Contradicted, or Unknown.

# Problem statement
* The project is focused on comprehensive evaluation of the existing state
of the art techniques for recognizing textual entailment
* The first step would be to do a survey on the existing state of the art
techniques for recognizing textual entailment
* The next step would be to go through the datasets available for recog-
nizing textual entailment
* Then the third step would be to implement two approaches and do a
comparative evaluation of the methods.
* This project also intends to look for the application of the textual
entailment for short answer grading

# Expected Goals

## Minumum
* To do the comparative evaluation of the two techniques which are
implemented To carry out the survey of the existing state of the art techniques
for recognizing textual entailment
* To carry out the survey for the existing datasets used for recog-
nizing textual entailment

## Expected
* To implement any of the two techniques used for recognizing textual entailment
* To do the comparative evaluation of the two techniques which are
implemented

## Maximum
* Implement the approach for short answer grading in a development server
